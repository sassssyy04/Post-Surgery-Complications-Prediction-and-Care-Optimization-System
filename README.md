# Post-Surgery-Complications-Prediction-and-Care-Optimization-System
The project aims to develop an advanced healthcare predictive system tailored to predicting post-surgery complications and optimizing patient care after surgical procedures. This system will use machine learning techniques to assess patient risks, predict complications, and provide personalized post-operative care recommendations.
